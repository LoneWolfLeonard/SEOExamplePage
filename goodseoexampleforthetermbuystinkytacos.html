<br><br>
<p>The First One Was Stolen From <a href="https://c3.staticflickr.com/1/640/31223866754_e37735bbdb_b.jpg" title="First Stolen Stinky Taco"> The First Stolen Image</a> & The Second Stinky Taco Masterpiece Was Lifted From <a href="http://whatshouldimakefor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4927.jpg" title="Second Stolen Stinky Taco"> The Second Stolen Image</a></p>

<center><h2>The Reason For The Taco Page Creation</h2></center>
<br>
<p>To show off seo technical stuff. Page speed is good. Meta tags are present for description and for robots info, as well as meta keywords for bing and yahoo. The page has cannonicals, links outbound with titles, images with titles and alt codes. Og info for facebook open graph and a high keyword density for the main term stinky tacos.</p>
<p>The site should also have a header bar that's consistent between the pages a sitemap.xml file. Including analytics, tag manager and a tracking pixel could also be good. I put the analytics tags from one of my other sites on here. Now I put the analytics tag on the head. On an actual wordpress page you'd want to put it in the body, so that it doesn't block the rendering of the page. A big page speed issue.</p>
